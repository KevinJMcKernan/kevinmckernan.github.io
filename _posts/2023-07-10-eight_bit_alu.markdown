# 8-Bit Computer - ALU Unit

The ALU unit is "fun". 

First attempt at drawing. "The paper and pen attempt". Failed after I started taping sheets of paper together. This feels like it would quickly lead to madness.

Second attempt at drawing. "The whiteboard attempt" Failed after I started crossing wires and smudging everything to kingdom come.
