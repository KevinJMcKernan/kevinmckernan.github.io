# QEMU and FreeBSD! 


Setup a new Linux box with a good amount of RAM. Decided to play around with QEMU and FreeBSD a bit! 

1. Installed QEMU and Virtual Machine Manager
2. Played with settings a fair bit.
3. Setup a FreeBSD VM.
4. Figured out how to setup Gnome
5. Figured out which virtual machine settings to enable in BIOS to get decent performance.

Loading. . . 

(Also Charlie Root threw me for a loop.)
