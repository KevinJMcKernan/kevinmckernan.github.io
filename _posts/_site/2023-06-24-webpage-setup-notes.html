<p>Going for a simple webpage setup I ran with github pages, jekyll and a custom domain from google domains.</p>

<p>Github Pages -&gt; https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart</p>

<p>Helpful Jekyll docs -&gt; https://jekyllrb.com/</p>

<p>Helpful Google Domains configuration -&gt; https://www.joelotz.com/blog/2020/setup-google-domain-for-github-pages.html</p>

<p>Side quests. Brand new computer, had to setup SSH auth for github. One fun bug, setting up the wrong CNAME url was a hilarious introduction to the TTL field I 
completely ignored. The hour long wait definitely was the most frustrating part of this setup.</p>
