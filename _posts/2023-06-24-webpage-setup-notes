Going for a simple webpage setup I ran with github pages, jekyll and a custom domain from google domains.

Github Pages -> https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart
Helpful Jekyll docs -> https://jekyllrb.com/
Helpful Google Domains configuration -> https://www.joelotz.com/blog/2020/setup-google-domain-for-github-pages.html

Side quests. Brand new computer, had to setup SSH auth for github. One fun bug, setting up the wrong CNAME url was a hilarious introduction to the TTL field I 
completely ignored. The hour long wait definitely was the most frustrating part of this setup. 



{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
