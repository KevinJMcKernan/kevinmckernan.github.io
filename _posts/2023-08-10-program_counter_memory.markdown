# 8-Bit Computer - Program Counter and Memory

The Ben Eater 8-bit computer kit is awesome.

Just completed the Program Counter and Memory components.

Note: Ran into an issue after completing the program counter where it would just repeat count 1. 
Pin 1 needs to be tied to 5V on the LS161AN Adder. Allowing it to float causes it to reset.
