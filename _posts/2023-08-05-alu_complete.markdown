# 8-Bit Computer - ALU Unit and 5V LEDs

Finally wrapped up the 8-bit ALU build out with working addition and subtraction and new 5V LEDs!

Along the journey ended up re-wiring the horrifying wiring job I started with. Photo I took along the way before replacing LED's

On another note, following some build advice on the Ben Eater subreddit I swapped out the kit provided LEDs with some 3mm diffuse 5V LEDs. These are a pretty big improvement and don't need a resistor to keep from (continually) burning out. 


5V LED's I used from Digikey:
